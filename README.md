# Project Ara
This is a prototype for complete hardware/software system to help blind navigate new environment using spatial sound.

## Product vision
The complete vison for the product includes a combination of hardware and software. Specifically:
1. Scanning hardware: A 3D scanning hardware (e.g. hololens or something lighter), or RGB camera + RGB-To-3D method (e.g., machine learning) 
2. Headphones: Headphones with variable noise cancellation (e.g. surface headphones), or bone conduction headphones (to allow user to hear the outside world at the same time)
3. Spatial audio generator: Unity spatial audio
